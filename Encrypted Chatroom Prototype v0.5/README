Hey!
Ive been working on this for a while now and im happy to say that the results are definately starting to show.
With this latest update i have added:
1. Registration and Login stability:
      Both the server and the client side should no longer throw a tantrum if you deviate from the usual login/registration routine.
2. Alot of Debugging messages:
      Ive installed a packet called icecream which prints additional information about a function or object when wrapped around it.
3. Clear rules for the server and clients to cut the threads of the connection in an orderly manner when needed.
